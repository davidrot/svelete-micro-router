Svelte-micro-router does what it says on the tin. It is very micro, please keep this in your mind if you are missing some features. 

# Features

- Small size / Micro
- Easy configuration (no sub route objects)
- Typescript
- Support for multiple router slots

# Installation 

``` bash
npm install svelte-micro-router --save
```



# Code Sample

This router is composed out of three parts (RouterInstance, RouterSlot, RouterLink). The RouterInstance what has the main logic (route matching, reading parameters from url). RouterSlot is to show the component of the current route. 

```typescript
// router-config.ts
import {RouterInstance, Route} from "svelte-micro-router";
import HomeComponent from "./Components/Home.svelte";
import AboutComponent from "./Components/About.svelte";
import UserComponent from "./Components/User.svelte";

RouterInstance.registerRoutes([
    new Route ('/', HomeComponent),
    new Route ('/about/', AboutComponent),
    new Route ('/user/:userId/', UserComponent),
    new Route ('/user/:userId/:name/', UserComponent),
]);
```

```html
// App.svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import {RouterLink, RouterSlot} from "svelte-micro-router";
</script>

<main>
	<div class="navigation">
		<RouterLink to="/">Home</RouterLink>
		<RouterLink to="/about/">About</RouterLink>
		<RouterLink to="/user/1/">User 1</RouterLink>
		<RouterLink to="/user/2/test/">User 2</RouterLink>
	</div>

	<RouterSlot></RouterSlot>
</main>
```

# Usage advices

Routes should have a slash at the end. Without a slash you get a different behavior. Example 

``` javascript
const href = '/user/1/something/';

// without trailing slash
let route = { path: '/user/:id' };
router.getParams(route, href) // {id: '1/something' };

// with trailing slash
route = { path: '/user/:id/' };
router.getParams(route, href) // {id: '1' };
```

This router instantiates the routeâ€™s component on every route change. Even when routing to a route with the same component as the previous route.

# Methods 

The router is having the following public methods. 

```typescript
/**
* Register routes to the router.
* @param  {Route[]} routes
* @returns void
*/
public registerRoutes(routes: Route[]): void

/**
* Unregister routes to the router.
* @param  {Route[]} removeRoutes
* @returns void
*/
public unregisterRoutes(removeRoutes: Route[]): void

/**
* To navigate to some other page.
* @param  {string} url
* @param  {boolean=true} pushState
* @returns void
*/
public navigate(url: string, pushState: boolean = true): void

/**
* Returns an object with the params from the url.
* @param  {string} url
* @param  {Route} route
* @returns Record
*/
public getCurrentParamsObj(): Record<string, string>: Record<string, string>
```


# Contribute

Please contribute with unit tests.

# Development 

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run serve
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

To run unit tests:

``` bash
npm run test
```

To run unit tests on every change:

``` bash
npm run test:watch
```


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
